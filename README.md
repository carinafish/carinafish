- 👋 Hi, I’m @carinafish,PhD. I research ocean change including marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, the organic geochemistry of deep sea corals, and geopolitics of deep sea mining.
- 👀 I’m interested in ocean justice and more broadly environmental justice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning queer of color critique, Black geographies, python, and base R ways of how to iterate in R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on/around engaged scholarship, Black Pacific Studies, and deep sea mining.
